                          The TOC coaching program was instrumental in propelling my career as a Software Developer at
                          InMobi. With a focused curriculum on Java and Data Structures, it equipped me with the essential
                          skills for real-world application. The coaching's hands-on approach and problem-solving emphasis
                          were crucial in preparing me for the challenges of the tech industry. The instructors' guidance
                          and personalized mentorship played a pivotal role in my success. The practical knowledge gained
                          directly contributed to my success in the InMobi interview process. Grateful for the program's
                          role in honing my technical expertise and problem-solving capabilities. TOC coaching was not just
                          education; it was a direct pathway to a rewarding career. Thanks to this coaching, I confidently
                          embraced the intricacies of software development at InMobi. I highly recommend TOC coaching for

                          I am pleased to provide a testimonial for my Java learning at TOC who has played a pivotal role in
                          shaping my understanding of Java programming during my time at Ramaiah Institute Of Technology
                          TOC possesses an exceptional ability to convey complex programming concepts with clarity and
                          enthusiasm. Their engaging teaching style, coupled with real-world examples, made the learning
                          experience both enjoyable and insightful. The way he focussed on the basics (JVM, JRE, OOPS) and
                          then encapsulated them with some advanced topics (Garbage Collector,Multithreading) sparked a
                          great interest in the subject.
                          TOC demonstrated a genuine commitment to every student's success. always willing to provide
                          guidance, whether through one-on-one consultations or during class discussions. This supportive
                          approach created a positive learning environment, fostering collaboration among students and
                          encouraging us to explore our programming potential.
                          Furthermore, TOC also showcased a keen understanding of industry trends, ensuring that the
                          curriculum remained relevant and aligned with the evolving landscape of Java development. This
                          forward-thinking approach instilled in me the confidence to tackle real-world challenges upon
                          entering the workforce.

                          When I came to Bengaluru in search of job in IT industry. Here i joined Abhishek Rajan Sir's
                          classes. He taught Java, DSA and some other topics. It was he who build problem solving skills in
                          me. He made me good in DSA. He taught lots of minute concepts in Java which rarely being taught by
                          others. Because of him only I got placed. And now also, his lessons not only helps me in cracking
                          interview but also working efficiently on the projects inside company.
